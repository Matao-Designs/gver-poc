TODO:

* determine best way to make sure that SVGs are compiled before HTML. this is especially a problem when first initializing the project, but should be smarter all around.
* allow for better paths to be used when calling SVGs from templates. right now they're relative - we may want to make them relative from src/twig (but without PHP, how? Do I need to switch from twig? I might.)
