TODO:

* determine best way to make sure that SVGs are compiled before HTML. this is especially a problem when first initializing the project, but should be smarter all around.
* allow for better paths to be used when calling SVGs from templates. right now they're relative - we may want to make them relative from src/twig (but without PHP, how? Do I need to switch from twig? I might.)
* header links need to be lockups with icons, and need to actually rely on invoca and live person. right now, it's all pretty static.
* when siteType is rm (Rocket Mortgage), the Spark font stack should be used. Else, it should be the old shit.
* set up the real JDP image assets (and the assets for 100 best places, bbb, and EHO)
* add We Want Your Feedback link to footer(?)
